It is simple and light. It works by default without a need for any settings. By default, 3 related downloads will be shown, related by download_tag. The title and featured image will be displayed, centered nicely. The related downloads are added right below the content of the single download.

It also includes a `.pot` file so you can easily translate into other languages.
