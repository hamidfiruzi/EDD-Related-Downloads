EDD - Related Downloads
=======================

Show related downloads by tag or category when using Easy Digital Downloads plugin.

This is an extension for Easy Digital Downloads that automatically adds related downloads after the single download content on the single download page. 
It is simple and light. It works by default without a need for any settings. By default, 3 related downloads will be shown, related by download_tag. The title and featured image will be displayed, centered nicely. The related downloads are added right below the content of the single download.
